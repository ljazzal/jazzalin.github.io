Welcome to my personal website! Here you'll find research projects undertaken as a robotics student at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) and the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca), and as a graduate researcher at the [**European Space Agency**](https://www.esa.int) and the [**ZHAW**](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/university/).

I previously completed internships in software development and robotics at [Clearpath Robotics](https://clearpathrobotics.com), [ABB Corporate Research Center](https://global.abb/group/en/technology/corporate-research-centers/switzerland) and [Honeywell](https://buildings.honeywell.com/us/en/home) [(Aerospace)](https://aerospace.honeywell.com/us/en/products-and-services/industry/space/satellite-products-and-systems).

Research interests:
