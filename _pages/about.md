As a MASc student at [UTIAS](https://www.utias.utoronto.ca/), I conduct research at the intersection of robotics and computational neuroscience. I am advised by Professor [G.M.T. D'Eleuterio](https://www.utias.utoronto.ca/research-and-centres/space-robotics/) and collaborate closely with the [Neural System and Brain Signal Processing Lab (NSBSPL)](https://sites.google.com/view/lnsbsp/home) at the [Krembil Research Institute](https://www.uhn.ca/Research/Research_Institutes/Krembil).


My background is in Mechatronics Engineering and AI at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). Over the course of my undergrad co-op program, I had the opportunity to get hands-on experience in automation and robotics, including as a research intern at the [ABB Corporate Research Center](https://global.abb/group/en/technology/corporate-research-centers/switzerland) in Switzerland and as a software developer at [Clearpath Robotics](https://clearpathrobotics.com/). <br /><br />


## Research interests

I am particularly interested in the combination of robust state estimation and control algorithms with neural oscillatory dynamics. As of June 2021, I have had the opportunity of working with [SpiNNaker neuromorphic hardware](http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/projects/SpiNNaker/project/Access/) (48-node board) to validate neuronal network models and explore strategies for closed-loop control. In the future, I hope to integrate my findings into a larger robotic system (e.g. [NRP](https://neurorobotics.net/)) to evaluate the influence of the environment on neuronal dynamics.

In general, I am very enthusiastic about the use of robotics as a tool to test hypotheses in neuroscience. Conversely, I firmly believe in drawing inspiration from Nature to design and ultimately better understand robotic systems.
