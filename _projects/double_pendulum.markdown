As a part-time undergraduate research assistant in nonlinear control, I setup and tested a rotary inverted double pendulum to support the investigation of nonlinear controller design based on the theory of virtual holonomic constraints. While time did not permit the implemetation of such constraints in the controller design, this project provided a good application of state space design and hands-on introduction to LQR
