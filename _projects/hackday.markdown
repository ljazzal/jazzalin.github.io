During the 2019 Clearpath Summer hackday challenge, our team of three decided to build yet another line marking robot for turf. However, instead of converting the office backyard into a soccer pitch, we thought we could pull-off a publicity stunt by printing the company logo, large enough to be captured by a drone's camera flying overhead. Well, we didn't quite get to that stage.. but we got pretty close! The logo was parsed as a polygon whose vertices were then converted into local GPS coordinates to allow for waypoint navigation.
