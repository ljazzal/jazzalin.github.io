During my internship at Clearpath Robotics, I was fortunate to be able to contribute to open-source software, mainly through the ROS ecosystem. From drivers for sensors commonly found on mobile robots to Gazebo simulations for Clearpath platforms, this experience was a great way to be involved in the development of robotics research. I developed the first iteration of the Clearpath Moose [Gazebo simulation](https://github.com/moose-cpr/moose_simulator), now available for ROS Kinetic!

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
